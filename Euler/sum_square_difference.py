The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
(1+2+...+10)2=552=3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025âˆ’385=2640.
Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
